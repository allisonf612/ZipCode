This software downloads the zipcodes for a given country code.  Current restrictions on Zipcode domain class limit its functionality to US but other country codes will not break it.  The xml downloaded from http://api.geonames.org/postalCodeSearch?placename=US&username=allisoneer only contains 17 states and 100 zipcodes so the data set is limited to that. 

Features:
* Add a new country with the country code to download for
* Load zipcodes into database for a given country
* clear zipcodes and states for a given country
* Delete countries

State and zipcode creation is limited to those parsed from loaded xml


The branch "downloadByStateAbbr" loads all the states for the US Country from BootStrap.  Then, for each state, the file will be downloaded and only zipcodes for the country code will be saved.

TESTS:
Tests are for master branch, not modified for downloadByStateAbbr branch
